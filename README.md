# Lois Kelly NLPProject
# Text Generation in the Lyrical Style of The Beatles


**Introduction**

This project is the exploration of generative text processes that use word-level language modelling to generate original lyrics in the style of The Beatles. The processes used include Markov Chains, Word RNN and Vector-Word RNN text generation. I am interested to see if the results of each process can generate full lines of lyrics or at least inspiration for song-writing in that style.

**Motivation:**
To explore the power of RNN models and see how they can contribute to the creative process. As a musician myself I am interested in how these processes can be used in music creation. I also am a big Beatles fan! 

**Build Status:**
There is lots that can still be explored within these notebooks and I hope to develop the project further using them. 

**Installation:**
All code within this poject is done using Python within the pre-set NLP Kernal. All imports are at the top of each notebook. 

**Tests:**
All tests were done within the test notebooks. I went back through and changed the input strings for RNNs and parametres for the Markov chains, as discussed in the essay
